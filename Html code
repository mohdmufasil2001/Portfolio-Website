			<p class="lead-para">
				The Text File Translator is a software application designed to facilitate the
				translation of text from one language to another. It provides a user-friendly interface
				that allows users to load a text file containing the source text and select the target
				language for translation. The application utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms
				and natural language processing techniques to accurately translate the text while
				preserving its meaning and context .The objective of this project is to translate small
				and large amount of information very easily. The input information which is to be
				translated to desired language is taken in the form of text file and the expected output
				will be in the form of translated text file. For one line translation, we can directly give
				input text and get the output text which is translated to desired language. But for text
				file translation, input is given in the form of text file and we expect the translated text
				file as output. We use 'googletrans ' python library that implemented Google Translate
				API in this project. By using this language translator any text and text file can be
				translated to any desired language. The language translator's job is to take content from
				one language and put it into another.

			<h4 class="headings">Medical Prescription OCR</h4>
			<p class="lead-para">
				Undoubtedly, today's doctors are extremely busy due to the high medical workload, they tend
				to scribble hard to read prescriptions which leads to confusion about the names of these drugs.
				Patients often want to know what medications are prescribed before buying them. This problem
				has been pondered by the developers for quite some time, but due to the bad or arguably bad
				handwriting of doctors and their variety, there is no technique to fully recognize the names of
				doctors. type of medicine. We thus lead to machine learning, where a system learns to recognize
				a new set of scripts based on different types of scripts for the same drug. By recognizing
				handwritten drug names, this article provides a solution to help pharmacists and patients have
				a system that returns readable digital text about the drug. The system determines drug names
				and dosages using preprocessing techniques such as image removal, noise reduction, and image
				resizing. In the next step, we will process pre-processed images by classifying and extracting
				their features using a convolutional neural network, and then apply optical character
				recognition ( OCR) to determine the drug name based on the comparison with the data set.
				contain all of them in post-processing. As a result, pharmacists will be able to minimize their
				doubts about the drug name, as cases of drug name distortion will be reduced. Based on the
				(CNN) model, the proposed system has achieved 70% accuracy in real cases.

				preprocessing techniques, convolutional neural network (CNN), optical character recognition
